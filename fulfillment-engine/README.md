# TONE Finance - Fulfillment Engine

A simple Go-based fulfillment engine for the TONE Finance sector vault. Listens for deposit events and automatically fulfills them by providing the underlying tokens.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Listens for `DepositRequested` events from the SectorVault contract
- ‚úÖ Automatically calculates underlying token amounts based on basket weights
- ‚úÖ Approves and transfers underlying tokens (WETH, UNI, AAVE)
- ‚úÖ Calls `fulfillDeposit` on the vault contract
- ‚úÖ **Automatic pending deposit handling** - checks and fulfills any pending deposits on startup
- ‚úÖ Block-based polling (no websocket dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown handling

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Private key with:
  - Base Sepolia ETH for gas
  - Sufficient underlying tokens (WETH, UNI, AAVE)
  - Fulfillment role on the SectorVault contract

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd fulfillment-engine
go mod download
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy the example env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your configuration:

```env
# Your fulfiller wallet private key (must have 0x prefix)
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# Base Sepolia RPC (default is fine)
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org

# Contract addresses (already configured from deployment)
SECTOR_VAULT=0x496c491D1E4fc8E563B212b143106732404D9CeE
WETH=0x12CF3cc4cCD61926DF90A3D127919aE34da9fab4
UNI=0x5C37E9c6b7abdd265047A3c6ed44AcE4c09F84c2
AAVE=0x2243c9B20CB8715c14800C58001C19f0d3846560

# Polling interval in seconds (12 seconds = ~1 block on Base)
POLL_INTERVAL=12
```

### 3. Ensure Wallet is Funded

Your fulfiller wallet needs:

```bash
# Check your balances
cast balance YOUR_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org

# Check token balances
cast call 0x12CF3cc4cCD61926DF90A3D127919aE34da9fab4 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" YOUR_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org
```

If you need tokens, the deployer has minted 11M of each token. You can transfer some:

```bash
# From the contract directory
source .env
cast send 0x12CF3cc4cCD61926DF90A3D127919aE34da9fab4 "transfer(address,uint256)" YOUR_FULFILLER_ADDRESS 1000000000000000000000000 --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Running the Engine

### Development Mode

```bash
go run .
```

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build
go build -o fulfillment-engine

# Run
./fulfillment-engine
```

## How It Works

### On Startup

1. **Pending Deposit Check**:
   - Queries the contract for total number of deposits (`nextDepositId`)
   - Checks each deposit to see if it's fulfilled
   - Automatically fulfills any pending deposits

2. **Continuous Polling**:
   - Every 12 seconds (configurable), queries for new `DepositRequested` events
   - Extracts deposit ID and quote amount from events

### For Each Deposit

3. **Token Calculation**: Calculates underlying token amounts based on basket weights:
   - WETH: 33.33%
   - UNI: 33.33%
   - AAVE: 33.34%
4. **Approval**: Approves each underlying token for the vault to spend
5. **Fulfillment**: Calls `fulfillDeposit()` with the calculated amounts
6. **Confirmation**: Waits for transaction confirmation and logs success

## Example Output

```

## Configuration

### Basket Weights

Current implementation uses fixed weights:
- WETH: 3333 basis points (33.33%)
- UNI: 3333 basis points (33.33%)
- AAVE: 3334 basis points (33.34%)

These match the vault's target weights and are hardcoded in `fulfiller.go`.

### Polling Interval

Adjust `POLL_INTERVAL` in `.env` to change how often the engine checks for new events:
- 12 seconds = ~1 block on Base Sepolia (recommended)
- Lower values = faster detection but more RPC calls
- Higher values = less RPC usage but slower detection

### Automatic Pending Deposit Handling

On every startup, the engine automatically:
- Queries the contract for the total number of deposits
- Checks each deposit to see if it's already fulfilled
- Automatically fulfills any pending deposits

This means:
- **First time running**: All existing pending deposits will be fulfilled automatically
- **After downtime**: Any deposits missed during downtime will be caught and fulfilled
- **No configuration needed**: Works out of the box

**Note**: For vaults with many deposits, the initial scan may take a moment as it queries each deposit individually.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load config: PRIVATE_KEY not set"
Make sure your `.env` file exists and contains `PRIVATE_KEY` with the `0x` prefix.

### "Invalid private key"
Ensure your private key is valid and starts with `0x`.

### "Insufficient funds"
Your fulfiller wallet needs Base Sepolia ETH for gas and underlying tokens (WETH, UNI, AAVE).

### "Transaction failed"
Check that:
- Your address is set as the `fulfillmentRole` on the vault
- You have approved sufficient token amounts
- The deposit hasn't already been fulfilled

## Architecture

```
main.go          - Entry point, handles shutdown
config.go        - Loads configuration from .env
contracts.go     - Contract ABIs and event definitions
fulfiller.go     - Core fulfillment logic (approve + fulfill)
listener.go      - Event polling and handling
```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is an alpha implementation for testnet use only**

- Private keys are stored in `.env` (ensure it's gitignored)
- No encryption at rest
- No transaction retry logic
- No advanced error recovery
- Not production-ready

For production, consider:
- Hardware wallet / KMS integration
- Transaction monitoring and retries
- Gas price optimization
- Multi-signature requirements
- Comprehensive error handling
- Monitoring and alerting
